Welcome to TagTree Docs, this dev expect you have a nice experience working on TagTree and hope to help you solving too many problems with artifacts creation.
TagTree module was divided in three main modules being one of them only a template that you should not worry about since you have an module abstraction extended by first one.
The project structure can be splitted in document, tag and tag tree. In simple way:
- Tags are added to another *tags*
- A group of tags grouped by a only one tag generate an *tag tree*
- Tag trees can be added to same level of file generating a *Document*

To example, checkout the diagram below:
